The following project is a deep learning based video summarization using object of interest detection. The main functionality of this project is mainly  on summarizing large videos and to generate a concise summary. The summary will be generated on the basis of object that will be detected in a video. The user will input a video , will select the object that has to be detected and the model will generate the parts of the video in which the object is detected. For this YOLOv8 model has been used for its very good performance.The dataset which is used is the MS COCO dataset. For the ease of end user a GUI desktop application has been designed so that the user can easily upload the video and select the object of its interest. Video download option is also given in the desktop application.
